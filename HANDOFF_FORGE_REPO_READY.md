# FORGE Repo-Ready Handoff

Date: 2026-05-24

Workspace:

- `/Users/aaronsunshine/Documents/Playground/FORGE-repo-ready`

GitHub repository:

- `https://github.com/WheelieGoodSkater/FORGE`

## Current State

FORGE is a Tampermonkey-based NetSuite companion drawer for consultant-led demo creation. The current package is repo-ready and public-scrubbed for GitHub. It includes the runnable drawer, FORGE branding assets, canonical runtime contract source modules, NetSuite adapter/runner files, archived planning evidence, trace samples, reports, and validation harnesses.

The repo is intentionally not just a one-file Tampermonkey package. It includes historical contract artifacts and harnesses so future work can validate changes without re-learning the long W214-W244 path.

## Main Runtime Files

- `idb-drawer.user.js`
  - Tampermonkey drawer script to install/update.
  - Current drawer includes FORGE branding, completed-result import, real Open-link guardrails, W214-W244 operating-mode / record-role contract work, and W244 legacy slot mapping helpers.
  - W245/W246 add canonical display-ready import records and versioned lane-pack live-demo coaching.

- `assets/FORGE.png`
  - Original FORGE logo asset.

- `assets/forge-header-logo-cropped.png`
  - Cropped drawer header logo asset.

- `src/contracts/operatingModes.js`
- `src/contracts/recordRoles.js`
- `src/contracts/importStates.js`
- `src/contracts/netSuiteLinks.js`
- `src/contracts/runnerResultCompatibility.js`
- `src/contracts/snapshot.js`
- `src/contracts/lanePacks.js`
  - Canonical runtime contract source modules introduced so the drawer, W144 adapter, and runner can converge on the same mode/role/link language.
  - `lanePacks.js` defines the first versioned industry/sub-industry pack contract for future expansion.

- `netsuite/idb_governed_runner_adapter_w144_suitelet.js`
  - Approved W144 adapter path.
  - Do not bypass this path from the drawer.

- `netsuite/runner/scai_ss_so_csv_runner_v4_0_0_runner_sandbox.js`
  - Current governed runner package included for continuity.

## Current Validation Commands

Run from `/Users/aaronsunshine/Documents/Playground/FORGE-repo-ready`:

```bash
npm run harness:contract-generated-legacy-slot-mapping-w244
npm run harness:canonical-import-result-normalization-w245
npm run harness:versioned-lane-pack-contract-w246
npm run check
npm run validate
```

Current expected result:

- W244 harness passes `10/10`.
- W245 harness passes `10/10`.
- W246 harness passes `10/10`.
- `check` passes syntax checks for drawer, W144 adapter, runner, contract modules, W244 harness, W245 harness, and W246 harness.
- `validate` currently aliases `check`.

## Latest Completed Work

Latest completed block:

- W246: Versioned Lane Pack Contract For Live Demo Coaching

What changed:

- Added the first versioned lane-pack contract, `forge.lane-pack.v1`.
- Added initial packs for industrial manufacturing, equipment manufacturing, industrial distributors, CPG distributors, CPG manufacturers, food/beverage manufacturers, dealer hardgoods, apparel/style matrix, and retail availability.
- Each pack defines lane/sub-industry identity, website/category evidence, operating mode, required/optional/invalid record roles, vocabulary bounds, proof move, story anchor, ROI/so-what, competitive contrast, and N/LLM advisory limits.
- W245 import normalization now carries W246 lane-pack resolution and advisory payloads so Review/Run can coach from returned records plus structured lane truth.
- N/LLM remains advisory-only and cannot create records, write transactions, silently install truth, override website evidence, override toggles, hide uncertainty, invent verified facts, or claim measured ROI without a baseline.

Important W246 helper names in `idb-drawer.user.js`:

- `versionedLanePacksW246`
- `validateLanePackW246`
- `resolveLanePackFromEvidenceW246`
- `nllmAdvisoryPayloadForLanePackW246`
- `liveDemoCoachingFromLanePackW246`

W246 harness:

- `archive/tools/run_w246_versioned_lane_pack_contract_harness.js`

W246 artifacts:

- `archive/reports/w246_versioned_lane_pack_contract.md`
- `archive/trace_samples/w246_versioned_lane_pack_contract_trace.json`

Previous completed block:

- W245: Canonical Import Result Normalization For Live Demo Coaching

What changed:

- Added a canonical display-ready record collection for completed runner imports.
- Normalizes legacy five-record, canonical `records[]`, and mixed alias payloads.
- Preserves record name, canonical role, consultant label, NetSuite record type, numeric internal id, supported Open URL, link authority, and source confidence.
- Uses W244 helpers for safe legacy slot / canonical role interpretation.
- Wires Build/Review/Run-facing paths to use the same normalized returned records after valid import.
- Adds live-demo coaching answers: what to open, what to prove, what is safe to say, what not to claim, and buyer-facing so what.
- Preserves W237 food batch saved-result repair behavior.
- Preserves fake Open-link blocking before valid import and hides non-openable records from normal consultant UI.

Important W245 helper names in `idb-drawer.user.js`:

- `canonicalImportResultNormalizationW245`
- `displayReadyRecordsFromFinalNamingW245`
- `canonicalImportRoleW245`
- `inferNetSuiteRecordTypeW245`

W245 harness:

- `archive/tools/run_w245_canonical_import_result_normalization_harness.js`

W245 artifacts:

- `archive/reports/w245_canonical_import_result_normalization.md`
- `archive/trace_samples/w245_canonical_import_result_normalization_trace.json`

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

Preserve these unless a future prompt explicitly changes them:

- No drawer-created records.
- No drawer transaction writes.
- No direct SuiteScript outside the approved W144 adapter path.
- Runner owns generated records.
- Image lookup disabled by default.
- N/LLM remains advisory only.
- Normal consultant UI must not show raw JSON, internal diagnostics, W144 endpoint, runner task ids, W151 language, semantic guard wording, mode contract wording, internal role arrays, stack traces, or raw guard messages.
- Open links appear only after valid completed import with numeric internal ids and supported NetSuite URLs.
- W218 frozen success wording and W220 recovery wording should remain stable unless intentionally revised.
- Do not run broad visual testing unless explicitly requested.
- Do not invoke the live runner unless explicitly requested.
- Do not update W144 deployment unless an install packet explicitly calls for it.

## Recent Product Lessons

- Website evidence should remain the primary naming authority.
- Toggles control operating-model vocabulary.
- Conversation notes should shape consultant story, ROI, objections, and run coaching, but should not override website/toggle naming authority.
- Food/ingredient/batch language requires food/batch/ingredient evidence or strong notes plus Manufacturing enabled.
- Manufacturing and WIP claims must stay honest: if records are missing, show partial/admin-debug warnings rather than pretending full support exists.
- The drawer must bring back completed runner names and real links into Build/Run once the runner returns a valid completed result.

## Recommended Next Block

```text
Move through W247: Lane Pack Authoring And Consultant Story Surface Hardening.

Goal:
Make lane-pack expansion and consultant live-demo storytelling easier to author, review, and trust without editing scattered runtime logic.

Build:
- Add a structured authoring/review harness for lane-pack changes.
- Add compact consultant-facing story output from the resolved lane pack plus W245 records:
  - open target
  - proof move
  - safe claim
  - do-not-claim guardrail
  - buyer-facing so what
  - N/LLM advisory confidence/uncertainty
- Add a sample proposed-lane-pack fixture that N/LLM could draft but cannot install without validation.
- Keep pack source in `src/contracts/lanePacks.js`; do not scatter new regex/story/naming edits.
- Keep N/LLM advisory-only and uncertainty-visible.
- Keep harnesses, reports, and traces under `archive/`.
- Keep repo front clean.

Validation:
- Add archived W247 harness covering:
  - lane-pack authoring fixture validation
  - rejected unsafe N/LLM proposed pack changes
  - consultant story surface uses W245 real records and W246 pack truth
  - uncertainty remains visible when evidence is weak
- Run only:
  - W244 harness
  - W245 harness
  - W246 harness
  - W247 harness
  - check
  - validate

Do not run broad visual testing.
Do not invoke the runner live.
Do not update W144 deployment.

Output:
- Consultant story surface helper.
- Lane-pack authoring review fixture.
- W247 regression harness.
- W247 report and trace.
- Visual testing decision.
- GitHub Desktop commit title and description.
- Best next Codex prompt.
```

## Install Note

For Tampermonkey install/update, use:

- `idb-drawer.user.js`

Do not update the W144 adapter, runner, SuiteScript deployment, or image lookup settings unless a future install packet explicitly says to.
